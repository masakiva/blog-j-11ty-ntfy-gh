# Junko's Blog

This is a personal blog for my mom, that I created using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

I made this project when I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The site is live at https://abejunko.netlify.app/.

The blog is hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a cloud-based platform for building and deploying static websites. Netlify allows for easy deployment and automatic updates to the blog as new content is added.
