# Junko's Blog

This is a personal blog for my mom, that I created using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

The blog is hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a cloud-based platform for building and deploying static websites. Netlify allows for easy deployment and automatic updates to the blog as new content is added.
